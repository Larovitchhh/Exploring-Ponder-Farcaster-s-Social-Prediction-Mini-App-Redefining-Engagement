Farcaster, a decentralized social network built on Ethereum, is revolutionizing how users interact online by prioritizing user ownership, permissionless innovation, and seamless app integration. At the heart of its ecosystem are Mini Apps, lightweight web-based applications built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrate directly into Farcaster clients, leveraging features like authentication, notifications, and wallet interactions. One standout Mini App, Ponder (accessible at https://ponder.social/), introduces a unique social prediction game rooted in the Keynesian beauty-contest concept, encouraging users to anticipate community sentiment while fostering engagement. This article explores Ponderâ€™s functionality, its role within Farcaster, and its broader significance in decentralized social networking.
