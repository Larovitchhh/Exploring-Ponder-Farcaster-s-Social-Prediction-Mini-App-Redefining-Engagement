Ponder is a Farcaster Mini App designed to enhance community engagement through a daily prediction game. Built on the Keynesian beauty-contest principle, Ponder challenges users to anticipate the majority’s choice on a given topic, requiring a small stake to participate. This gamified approach encourages thoughtful interaction, as players must gauge community sentiment rather than simply express their own opinions. While specific gameplay details are not fully outlined in public documentation, Ponder likely integrates with Farcaster’s feed, allowing users to submit predictions, view results, and engage in discussions via casts within channels.As a Mini App, Ponder operates within Farcaster clients, utilizing the Farcaster Mini App SDK to access features like Sign In with Farcaster (SIWF) for secure authentication and wallet functionality for staking. Its lightweight design ensures seamless interaction, making it a natural fit for Farcaster’s permissionless and user-centric environment.
